## Introduction
> I am a skilled software developer with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Michigan State University and 10 years of experience, focusing on web development. For the past five years I have been working remotely at an IoT start-up where I am responsible for developing and maintaining the company’s software and server infrastructure. I have dedicated the last 14 months of nights and weekends to touch, understand, and implement as many aspects of game development as possible.

# Primary Project & Prototypes
> 'UO:Defender 2', a tower defense, has been my primary project and guide in learning. Written in C# using the Godot Engine, this is my third iteration of the same idea.
> The progress I have made can been seen from prototype 1, to 2, to the current version that exists today. My only goal in creating this project is to learn, and I have learned a lot so far!

> - Details
>   - This work in progress is a 2D Tower Defense game, written in C# using the Godot engine.
>   - I was able to put together a lot of what I had learned from tutorials as well as from the previous two prototypes to approach this design thoughtfully. This work in progress has been an excellent teacher.

>    - <b>[Screen Shots](#primary-proto-2-screen-shots)</b>
>  - Details
>    - Abandoned when I realized making the art look good in 3D was not worth it. I was pushing for 3D because I felt I would learn more math, but not having to create my own art was invaluable to me. 
>    - This project let me experiment with building many basic systems such as mobiles, attacks, and navigation. Much of this thought-work influenced the current version of the project.

<span id="uodef-features-section"></span>

- ### Expandable Mobile Base Class
>
> The thoughtful design of my [Mobile](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Mobile.cs) class and its [surrounding features](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles) have made [creating mobiles](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Towers/Archer.cs) and allowing them to interact throughout the system incredibly intuitive and straight forward! 
>
> <img src="_ReadMEAssets/UODefenderGifs/UODefender2/CodeExamples/Tower_and_Creature_Init.png" loading="lazy">
>  <br>
> Which has enabled me to easily create, clothe, animate, and program new attacks for several towers
> <div align="center"><img src="_ReadMEAssets/UODefenderGifs/UODefender2/Towers/Tower_Options.png" loading="lazy"></div>

- ### A Dynamic Attack Base Class
>
> A powerful and dynamic [base attack](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Abilities/Attacks/BaseAttack.cs) class connects into hooks throughout the code base to allow for its inheritors to be very [simple attacks](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Abilities/Attacks/PugilistsGloves.cs), or more [complex attacks](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Abilities/Attacks/TempestsBoltAttack.cs) with [projectiles](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Abilities/Projectiles/BaseProjectile.cs).
>
> <img src="_ReadMEAssets/UODefenderGifs/UODefender2/CodeExamples/AttackSetup_SS.png" loading="lazy">

- ### Custom Animation Player Allows for plug-and-play use of any UO mobile animated art, and of any UO hue.
>
> My custom animation player allows me to interact with sprite sheets in a robust, and expandable way. The [AnimationPlayer](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Animation/MobileAnimationPlayer.cs) utilizes [Animated Sprites](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Animation/AnimatedSprite.cs) to play animations defined by the [AnimationDefinitionLibrary](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Animation/AnimationDefinitionLibrary.cs), all in service of animating each [Mobile](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Mobile.cs) 

- ### Plus much, much more
> - Plus many more partially implemented systems that work but are not implemented as full game features such as the [XP and Leveling System](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Leveling/XPManager.cs), and [spawn series with difficulty curves](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/EnemyMgmt/EnemySpawnSeries) for creating enemy spawns!
> - And also, features that are implemented, but have so much room to grow like the [intelligence FSM](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Mobiles/Intelligence/BaseIntelligence.cs), more [buildings](PrimaryProjects/UODefender2D_CurrentVersion/src/Scenes/Structures) with complex behaviors, and many more.

# Prototype 2 - <a href="PrimaryProjects/UODefender_PrototypeTwo/src" target="_blank">Code</a>
> Prototype 2 was created to continue down the path of creating something to teach myself. It was abandoned because making the UO art work in 3D space was a fools errand, but I learned so much getting to that point that this was valuable time spent.
